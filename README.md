# Renso-marketchain
Revolutionizing Retail with Decentralized Commerce

Overview
Renso Marketchain is a decentralized marketplace designed to transform the retail industry by leveraging blockchain, AI, and geolocation technologies. Our mission is to create a transparent, efficient, and consumer-centric ecosystem where brands, retailers, and consumers can thrive together.

By decentralizing the retail value chain, Renso Marketchain empowers small businesses, ensures fair compensation for all stakeholders, and provides consumers with unparalleled transparency and trust.

Community-Driven Retail: Tools for retailers to create immersive, community-focused experiences.
Shoppers Program: A decentralized delivery network where consumers can earn by delivering products locally.

Technology Stack
Blockchain: Ethereum, Solidity, Smart Contracts
AI/ML: Demand forecasting, personalized recommendations, dynamic pricing
